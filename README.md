The Jupyter notebooks perform the following tasks:

- **FPS_CLASSIFICATION**: Creates the distance matrices. The FPS is different in each version but a seed is fix to each iteration starting from seed=100. 
- **STATISTIC_CLASSIFICATION**: Repeats the experiment using 2000 different train set selections and computes the mean and standard deviation of the results.
